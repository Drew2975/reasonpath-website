# ReasonPath News-to-Knowledge Pipeline
## Strategic Documentation & Implementation Plan

---

## üéØ Executive Summary

**Vision:** Transform AI news into structured learning pathways, creating a "Learning Accelerator" disguised as a news feed.

**Current Reality:** ReasonPath has excellent technical infrastructure:
- ‚úÖ 150-term AI Glossary (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Academy course structure (built)
- ‚úÖ Labs testing ground (ready)
- ‚úÖ Glass morphism UI (98% browser support)
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Dynamic content to drive daily engagement

**Problem:** We built a "technically beautiful ghost town" - everything works flawlessly but there's no reason to return.

**Solution:** Build a content operations platform that processes external news through educational layers, turning every story into a learning journey with full automation from curation to deployment.

## üèóÔ∏è The Custom Control Tool (Content Operations Platform)

### Core Innovation
Not just an aggregator - a complete **content operations platform** that:
1. Aggregates from multiple sources
2. Allows manual story addition
3. Requires human approval
4. Generates structured commands
5. Triggers automated deployment

### Architecture
```
[AGGREGATOR] ‚Üí [DREW'S CURATION] ‚Üí [INSTRUCTION PACKAGE] ‚Üí [CLAUDE EXECUTES]
     ‚Üì              ‚Üì                      ‚Üì                      ‚Üì
 RSS feeds    Add own stories    JSON with commands    Full automation
                Edit/approve      Including deploy      No manual steps
```

### Output Structure
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2024-12-20T08:00:00Z",
  "approved_by": "Drew",
  "stories": [
    {
      "title": "OpenAI Announces o3",
      "summary": "Drew's edited summary",
      "category": "Models & Research",
      "glossary_terms": ["reasoning", "benchmarks"],
      "course_link": "how-ai-thinks/lesson-3",
      "pathway_type": "mini"
    }
  ],
  "commands": [
    {
      "action": "generate_html",
      "template": "news_feed",
      "include_pathways": true
    },
    {
      "action": "update_glossary_links",
      "auto_link": true
    },
    {
      "action": "deploy",
      "method": "git_push",
      "branch": "main",
      "host": "github_pages"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Build Complexity
- **Basic version:** 2-3 days (Python Flask + SQLite)
- **Full featured:** 1-2 weeks (includes all automation)
- **Tech stack:** Simple, maintainable, no external dependencies

## üìä Core Concept: The Layer System

### Processing Pipeline
Every piece of external news flows through 5 transformation layers:

1. **üì° Intake Layer**
   - Raw news from 50+ sources
   - 10,000 pieces/day incoming
   - **No paid APIs initially** - RSS feeds only

2. **üîÑ Translation Layer**
   - Convert technical jargon to plain English
   - Add reality checks and hype scores
   - Simplify without dumbing down
   - **Manual initially, AI-enhanced later**

3. **üìö Education Mapping Layer**
   - Auto-link glossary terms (pattern matching)
   - Connect to relevant courses (rule-based)
   - Map to available labs (manual tagging)
   - **ONLY WE DO THIS** - Our competitive moat

4. **üéöÔ∏è Depth Selection Layer**
   - 5-second summary
   - 1-minute context
   - 5+ minute deep dive
   - User chooses engagement level

5. **üë• Community Enhancement Layer**
   - Expert annotations
   - Beginner questions
   - Crowd-sourced explanations
   - **Phase 2 feature**

---

## üóÇÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Classification Taxonomy

#### Top-Level Categories
1. **Models & Research** - New models, benchmarks, training techniques
2. **Policy & Regulation** - Laws, safety frameworks, government actions
3. **Industry & Business** - Funding, acquisitions, corporate strategy
4. **Applications & Use Cases** - Real-world deployments
5. **Tools & Infrastructure** - Developer tools, APIs, frameworks
6. **Ethics & Society** - Bias, alignment, cultural impact

### Aggregation Strategy (No APIs)

#### Free Sources Only
```python
# Zero-cost automation
feeds = [
    'https://techcrunch.com/ai/feed/',
    'https://arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI',
    'https://news.ycombinator.com/rss',
    # 20+ free RSS feeds
]

# Rule-based classification (no GPT costs)
def classify_story(title, content):
    if 'gpt' in title.lower() or 'model' in title.lower():
        return 'Models & Research'
    # etc...

# Pattern matching for terms (uses existing glossary)
def extract_terms(text):
    return [term for term in our_150_terms if term in text]
```

#### The Funnel
```
10,000 pieces/day
    ‚Üì
1,000 relevant (filtered)
    ‚Üì
100 unique stories (deduplicated)
    ‚Üì
20 important (prioritized)
    ‚Üì
5-10 MUST KNOW (Drew curates)
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Decisions Required

### Immediate (This Week)
1. **MVP Stories:** Start with 5 or 10 daily?
2. **Categories:** All 6 or focus on 2-3?
3. **Prototype:** Standalone or integrate?
4. **Timeline:** Launch Monday or polish more?

### Technical (Next Week)
- **Hosting:** GitHub Pages (free) vs Netlify vs Custom
- **Database:** JSON files vs SQLite vs PostgreSQL
- **Deployment:** Git push vs GitHub Actions vs Manual
- **Language:** Python (simple) vs Node.js vs Both

### Strategic (Month 1)
- **Monetization:** Free forever vs Premium tier
- **Community:** Read-only vs Contributions
- **Scope:** AI only vs Broader tech
- **APIs:** When to add paid services
