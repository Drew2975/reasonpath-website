# 📑 Feasibility Report: ReasonPath Mobile Command Center

## 🔍 Technical Feasibility Assessment

**Architecture Soundness**\
- The hybrid **APK → PC API → Claude MCP → Website** model is viable.
Similar architectures (mobile client + local API + automation backend)
already exist in enterprise workflows.\
- Strength: Snapshot database handoff ensures no locking during morning
approvals.\
- Watchpoint: PC-side dependency means uptime hinges on one
machine---consider cloud redundancy later.

**Security Model**\
- Cloudflare Tunnel + device-bound JWT + daily rotating preview tokens =
strong baseline.\
- Risks: JWT refresh logic and offline approval queues could desync.
Suggest adding *refresh token + replay protection* at API layer.\
- Daily token rotation is good, but requires smooth UX---fallback path
needed if token rotation fails mid-review.

**Database Strategy**\
- Snapshot pattern is solid for read/write separation. SQLite + VACUUM
INTO is lightweight and stable.\
- Risk: Growth to 1,000+ users could stress SQLite. Migration path to
Postgres should be sketched out early.

**API Design**\
- Flask endpoints + SSE streaming is a proven stack.\
- Risk: SSE less reliable on flaky mobile networks. Consider WebSockets
fallback.\
- Job queue design (lane separation) is strong.

**Mobile Development**\
- Swipe gestures, drag-to-reorder, haptic feedback---all feasible in
Android Studio.\
- Concern: Offline queue conflict resolution could be tricky---test
rigorously.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🏗️ Implementation Risk Analysis

**Timeline Realism**\
- Four weeks is aggressive but possible if Drew + Claude stay focused.
MCP integration and APK polish are likely to spill into Week 5--6.

**Resource Requirements**\
- Skills required: Android Kotlin, Flask/Python, SQLite/SQL, DevOps
(Cloudflare, Git automation). Any gaps here will delay.

**Dependency Risks**\
- RSS feeds are brittle (format changes, outages). Need monitoring +
fallback.\
- GitHub deployment is a single point of failure---add retry & PR
fallback already noted.

**Testing Challenges**\
- With no large user base, simulate load: script API calls, stress
SQLite snapshot creation, test push notification timing.

**Deployment Complexity**\
- PowerShell deployment pipeline is clever, but Windows-specific. If
scaling, consider CI/CD portability (GitHub Actions, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 💼 Business Model Validation

**Market Opportunity**\
- Differentiation is clear: no one else blends **news → learning →
application**. Strategic moat is real.

**Revenue Projections**\
- \$8/month tier: plausible, but adoption depends on proving daily
habit-forming value.\
- Break-even at 2 subs is realistic; hitting \$8k/month needs viral
growth loop.

**User Adoption**\
- Asking users to swap casual scrolling for structured pathways is
ambitious. Anchor use case could be *"2-minute morning brief"* with
optional depth.

**Competition Response**\
- TechCrunch could expand into explainers; Coursera could add "current
events" modules. Neither moves fast---ReasonPath has a timing advantage.

**Scalability Economics**\
- Infrastructure scales cheaply at 1,000 users. Cost curve is favorable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🎯 User Experience Concerns

**Mobile Workflow**\
- 2-minute approval flow is realistic if story cards are well-prepared.
Risk is cognitive overload if deduplication fails.

**Learning Pathways**\
- Completion of 15-minute journeys will skew to motivated users. Need
lightweight checkpoints (quizlets, micro-content).

**Content Quality**\
- Rule-based classification + glossary matching works to start. But at
scale, quality gap vs human editors may show. Gradual ML model
integration advised.

**Mobile UI**\
- Swipe-to-approve works for small sets, but fatigue risk if \>20/day.
Batch-approve modes could help.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ⚡ Strategic Recommendations

**Architecture Improvements**\
- Add WebSocket fallback for SSE.\
- Define migration path: SQLite → Postgres.\
- Abstract deployment pipeline to cross-platform CI/CD.

**Risk Mitigation**\
- Implement monitoring for RSS feed health.\
- Build token refresh fallback for JWT rotation.\
- Add CI test harness simulating offline approval conflicts.

**MVP Simplification**\
- Phase 1: skip Claude MCP automation. Focus purely on News → Pathway
publishing. Add automation in Phase 2 once core loop is validated.

**Growth Strategy**\
- Focus on **daily "must-know 5 stories"** brand hook.\
- Layer viral sharing (one-tap share of learning pathway card).\
- Early adopters: AI students, tech workers seeking structured skimmable
learning.

**Alternative Approaches**\
- Could invert pipeline: launch as newsletter first (email → pathway),
then evolve mobile app. Less engineering upfront.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🚨 Critical Success Factors

**Must-Have Features**\
- Snapshot DB handoff (keeps mornings smooth).\
- Mobile 2-min approval UX.\
- Learning pathway auto-mapping.

**Nice-to-Have Features**\
- Claude MCP automation.\
- Community annotation layer.\
- Advanced analytics dashboards.

**Failure Modes**\
- Story deduplication fails → overwhelming noise.\
- Token rotation bugs → blocked approvals.\
- Poor pathway quality → users churn after 1 week.

**Success Metrics**\
- Daily approval time \<2 minutes.\
- \>20% click-through into learning pathways.\
- \>30% completion of 15-min pathways.\
- \>40% daily return rate.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 🧭 Closing Take

The architecture is clever and frugal---lean startup at its best. The
biggest risks aren't technical but behavioral: will people actually use
structured learning pathways daily? Anchor on a simple, addictive core
(the "2-minute 5 stories") and let the deeper learning pathways be a
pull, not a push.
