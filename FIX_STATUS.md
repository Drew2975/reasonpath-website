# FIXES COMPLETED - Status Report
Date: 2025-08-29
Branch: fix/unminify-mainjs

## ✅ COMPLETED FIXES

### 1. Unminified JavaScript (main.js)
- **Previous state:** Single line with 2087 characters
- **Current state:** Properly formatted with 99 lines
- **Backup created:** main.min.js.backup

### 2. Fixed CSS Link
- **File:** index.html line 22
- **Previous:** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/styles.css">`
- **Current:** `<link rel="stylesheet" href="assets/css/master.css">`
- **Note:** styles.css doesn't exist, master.css does (739 lines, BEM methodology)

### 3. Cleaned Up Root Directory
- **Moved to archive_cleanup folder:**
  - dictionary_fix.js (duplicate implementation)
  - dictionary_fixed.js (duplicate implementation)
  - direct-test.html (test file)
  - final-working.html (test file)
  - scaled-final.html (test file)
  - working-hero.html (test file)
  - test_fixes.html (test file)
  - hero-animation-vortex.html (test file)
  - hero-onramp.html (test file)
  - reasonpath-complete-clean.html (test file)
- **Result:** Root directory is now cleaner and focused on production files

## ⚠️ REMAINING ISSUES (Not Fixed Yet)

### High Priority
1. **Navigation not working** - Links have href="#" and rely on JavaScript that may be broken
2. **Multiple CSS systems** - Still have both master.css and components.css
3. **TypeScript files in src/** - No compilation pipeline
4. **Lottie animation code** - Still references CDN that CSP blocks

### Medium Priority
1. **No build pipeline** - package.json has no build scripts
2. **Event listener cleanup** - Potential memory leaks
3. **Error handling** - No try/catch blocks in main.js

### Low Priority
1. **Documentation** - Missing README
2. **Tests** - No test coverage
3. **Performance monitoring** - No Web Vitals tracking

## FILES PRESERVED (NOT DELETED)
- All core functionality files kept intact
- Documentation files preserved
- Configuration files maintained
- Assets folder untouched

## NEXT STEPS
1. Test if navigation works by opening index.html in browser
2. Decide whether to remove Lottie code entirely
3. Set up Vite or similar build tool
4. Choose between master.css or create new unified CSS

## GIT STATUS
- Changes made directly via filesystem tools
- Ready to commit when PowerShell terminal is cleared
- Branch: fix/unminify-mainjs
