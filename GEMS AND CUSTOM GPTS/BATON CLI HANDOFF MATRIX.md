# Baton Handoff Matrix (CLI Edition)

## What This Is
The **Baton Handoff** is a workflow for sequencing your AI CLIsâ€”**Claude Code CLI**, **Codex CLI (GPT-5)**, and **Gemini Code Assist CLI**â€”like runners in a relay. Itâ€™s a **reference, not a rulebook**. Think of it as a playbook: adapt it based on project needs and how each CLI performs.

## Pre-Flight: Runner Choice

**Complexity check**
- **Algorithms / tricky logic** â†’ include **Codex**  
- **Architecture / reliability critical** â†’ include **Claude**  
- **Repo-scale refactor / multilingual** â†’ include **Gemini**

**Subagents (optional)**
- ðŸ§ª Claude subagent â€” testing/TDD  
- ðŸ§© Gemini subagent â€” UI/style consistency  
- âš¡ Codex subagent â€” perf/debugging hot-spots

## Role Snapshots

### â€‹ Claude Code CLI
- **Benchmarks:** ~67% on SWE-bench (public leader)  
- **Experience:** Scaffolding + safe design + TDD  
- **Caveat:** Needs chunked scope; not ideal for giant repos  

### â€‹ Codex CLI (GPT-5)
- **Benchmarks:** ~69% (public), 74.9% reported internally  
- **Experience:** Fast MVPs, algorithms, debugging  
- **Caveat:** Can go off-track if not scoped or framed  

### â€‹ Gemini Code Assist CLI
- **Benchmarks:** ~63% but supports 1M-token context  
- **Experience:** Best at repo-scale refactors & consistency  
- **Caveat:** May leave skeletons unless exit criteria are clear

## Quick Rules of Thumb
- **1 CLI** is enough for small, scoped tasks  
- **2 CLIs** (Claudeâ†’Codex or Claudeâ†’Gemini) for medium tasks  
- **3 CLIs** for large, complex, or multilingual jobs  
- Always define **exit criteria**: tests pass, lint clean, docstrings present
