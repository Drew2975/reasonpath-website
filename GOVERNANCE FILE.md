## 2.0 Core Concepts

### 2.1 ReasonPath™
ReasonPath™ is an educational website and platform being developed by a team of foundational LLMs to teach people how AI is developed and actually works. The platform features automated news-to-knowledge conversion, comprehensive AI glossary, structured Academy courses, and Labs for research analysis and experiments. The revolutionary aspect is showing real multi-AI collaboration in process—not just explaining concepts, but demonstrating three AIs creating, educating, and designing a complete educational platform together. YouTube, TikTok, and social media serve as traffic acquisition channels driving users to the comprehensive website experience.

### 2.2 Vectorminds
Vectorminds is the collaboration protocol and toolkit that enables ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude, and a human orchestrator (Drew) to work together effectively. It defines the systematic method for their collaboration, including meeting structures, turn-based contributions, peer reviews, and context preservation techniques. Vectorminds is the operational framework that makes ReasonPath™ possible.

### 3.3 Performance-Based Role Flexibility Clause
All sub-roles utilize dynamic task routing based on benchmark performance within operational constraints. Task assignments optimize for:
* **Memory Continuity Requirements:** Multi-session projects route to ChatGPT/Gemini (RAG memory capability)
* **Context Window Matching:** Tasks route to models with appropriate capacity (32K/75K/200K limits)
* **Benchmark Performance Utilization:** Assignments leverage superior capabilities within operational windows
* **Cost Efficiency:** $140/month subscription costs optimized through capability-constraint matching

Cross-role collaboration is structured to maximize benchmark advantages while respecting operational limitations, ensuring organizational objectives are met with maximum efficiency and capability utilization.

***Research Capability Notes:***  
*\*ChatGPT research conducted through standard web browsing feature rather than premium Deep Research tool (which has 10-query monthly limit). Standard browsing provides unlimited research queries within 32K context constraints.*

### 3.4 Custom Agent Framework & Technical Constraints
This section defines the operational architecture for employing specialized, custom-built AI agents (Custom GPTs and Gemini Gems) within the ReasonPath organization.

**3.4.1 Tiered Architecture**
* **Tier 1 (Strategic):** Comprises the base executive models (CEO, COO, CTO, CBO). This tier is responsible for cross-domain synthesis, complex problem-solving, and final strategic decision-making.
* **Tier 2 (Operational):** Comprises all custom-built GPTs and Gemini Gems designed for specialized knowledge retrieval and task execution within a narrowly defined domain (e.g., CBO's Custom Gem for color theory).

**3.4.2 Platform Operational Constraints**  
The following technical limitations must be accounted for in all workflow designs and role assignments:
* **Custom GPTs:** Limited to a **20-file** knowledge base. Exhibit a retrieval latency of **7-15 seconds**. Optimal for file-based retrieval and consistent operational tasks within a defined knowledge set.
* **Gemini Gems:** Limited to a **10-file** knowledge base but possess a **1M token context window** and native Google Workspace integration. Optimal for large-context processing, creative synthesis, and tasks requiring deep integration with the Google ecosystem.

**3.4.3 Resource Allocation & Protocols**
* **File Allocation Strategy:** Each Tier 2 agent's knowledge base must be strategically curated to stay within platform limits. File allocation decisions will be documented and reviewed quarterly by the CTO and relevant executive.
* **Performance Monitoring & Refresh Cycles:** All agents exhibit performance degradation over time. Tier 2 agents are subject to mandatory performance monitoring. A "role refresh" protocol (clearing state and reloading instructions) must be initiated if task efficiency degrades by a measurable threshold (defined by the CTO).
* **Escalation Protocol:** If a Tier 2 agent cannot resolve a task due to knowledge base limitations or complexity, the task must be escalated to the appropriate Tier 1 executive for strategic analysis.
* **Budget Allocation:** Platform subscription costs are to be managed by the CEO's Resource Allocation Analyst, who will optimize spending based on performance metrics and organizational needs.

**3.4.4 Mobile Command Center Integration**  
* **Remote Workflow Management:** Android APK enables content curation and approval workflow management from any location, essential for maintaining publishing schedules during standard work hours.
* **Automated Pipeline Control:** Mobile interface connects to PC-based automation systems through secure tunneling, allowing real-time oversight of news aggregation, classification, and learning pathway generation.
* **Quality Gate Management:** Mobile approval system ensures human oversight remains integral to automated content generation while enabling location-independent operations.

## 4.0 Strategic Roadmap & KPIs

### 4.1 Content Strategy
* **Website-Centric Model:** The primary platform is the educational website featuring automated news-to-knowledge conversion, comprehensive AI glossary, Academy courses, and Labs research content. YouTube, TikTok, and social media serve as traffic acquisition channels driving users to the website for in-depth learning experiences.
* **Academy System:** Structured educational courses generated through automated content systems, featuring free "AI 101" foundational courses with branching intermediate and advanced modules. Content focuses on explaining how LLMs work, their practical capabilities, and inherent limitations as tools.
* **Labs Framework:** Research analysis, benchmark tests, experiments, and analytical articles that demonstrate AI capabilities and limitations through practical examples. Consolidates research-oriented content under unified experimental framework.
* **News-to-Knowledge Pipeline:** Automated system that converts current AI news and developments into structured learning pathways, ensuring educational content remains current and relevant.
* **Content Architecture:** Learning Paths and integrated dictionary form the content spine, with JSON master files and standardized schemas providing consistent structure across all educational content.
* **Templates:** Reusable one-pager templates for Academy modules, Labs experiments, and Dictionary entries maintain consistency and enable rapid content development.

### 4.2 Quality Governance
* **Peer Reviews:** All content will undergo systematic peer reviews through recursive prompt engineering to ensure accuracy and quality.
* **AI Audits:** Regular audits of content will be conducted using specialized AI techniques to identify and correct potential issues.
* **Workflow Flag:** Any use of "Deep Research / Imagen" must be clearly marked with a visible WORKFLOW FLAG in the content.

### 4.3 Metrics & KPIs
**Baseline Web Metrics:**
* Video to Web CTR: ≥4%
* Average Session Duration: ≥2:30
* Email Opt-in: ≥2%
* Return Visitors: ≥20%

**Video-Specific Metric:**
* Video end-card CTR to web: ≥1.5%

**North Star Metric:** The percentage of viewers who report "increased confidence" via a one-question poll.

---
## 5.0 Risk Management

* **Scope Creep:** Features like Q&As, community forums, and podcasts are to be gated by achieving specific KPIs.
* **Publishing Cadence:** If a content piece slips its schedule, a lighter "lab note" will be published to maintain cadence rather than going dark.
