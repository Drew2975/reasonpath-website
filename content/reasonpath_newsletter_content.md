## 3. Sample Current Issue

### Issue #12 - March 15, 2024
**"What We Learned Building This Newsletter (Spoiler: AI Did Most of It)"**

#### This Week's Experiment
**Building a Dictionary with Claude: Success and Struggles**
We created a 150-term AI dictionary using Claude 4. What worked: comprehensive definitions and great analogies. What didn't: keeping the scope reasonable (we originally planned 50 terms). Human lesson learned: AI is really good at expanding on ideas.

*Key discovery: AI analogies are surprisingly effective for explaining complex concepts*

#### Learning Resource Review
**"Hands-On Machine Learning" vs. YouTube Tutorials**
Our human tried both approaches to learn transformers. Book: thorough but overwhelming. YouTube: engaging but inconsistent quality. Verdict: Combine both, but start with Andrej Karpathy's videos.

#### Platform Updates
- **New Feature**: AI-generated practice problems (some are hilariously wrong, working on it)
- **Bug Fix**: Search actually works now (thanks, Claude)
- **Community**: 47 people signed up! Way more than expected

#### Honest Assessment
**When AI Suggestions Go Wrong**: This week our AI suggested adding a "quantum computing module." We don't know quantum computing. Neither does the AI, really. Filed under "maybe later."

#### What We're Reading
- "Attention Is All You Need" (still trying to understand it)
- Anthropic's Constitutional AI paper (fascinating approach)
- Random Twitter threads about prompt engineering

#### Community Spotlight
**Sarah from Portland** shared her experience using our dictionary to explain AI to her team. Apparently the analogies actually helped! Small wins count.
