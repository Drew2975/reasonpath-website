# ReasonPath News-to-Knowledge Pipeline (CORRECTED SCOPE)
## Strategic Documentation & Implementation Plan - Updated with Realistic Processing Volume

---

## üéØ Executive Summary (Updated)

**Vision:** Transform AI insider intelligence into structured learning pathways, creating a "Learning Accelerator" with competitive moat through exclusive content access.

**Current Reality:** ReasonPath has excellent technical infrastructure:
- ‚úÖ 150-term AI Glossary (fully functional)
- ‚úÖ Academy course structure (built)
- ‚úÖ Labs testing ground (ready)
- ‚úÖ Glass morphism UI (98% browser support)
- ‚úÖ **Secret Weapon:** r/singularity insider intelligence access
- ‚ùå **Missing:** Daily content curation workflow

**Problem:** We built a "technically beautiful ghost town" - everything works flawlessly but there's no reason to return.

**Solution:** Build a content intelligence platform that combines RSS automation with r/singularity insider curation, creating unique learning pathways unavailable elsewhere.

## üéØ The Secret Sauce: r/singularity Intelligence Advantage

### **Why r/singularity Changes Everything**
- **1 million+ subscribers** including industry insiders, researchers, company employees
- **Early access content** appears days/weeks before mainstream media coverage
- **Technical accuracy** maintained by knowledgeable community voting
- **Insider perspectives** from actual AI researchers and practitioners
- **Superior signal-to-noise ratio** through community curation
- **Unique content** that mainstream aggregators completely miss

### **Competitive Moat Analysis**
```
Traditional Aggregators: RSS feeds ‚Üí automated filtering ‚Üí generic tech news
ReasonPath Intelligence: r/singularity insider posts + RSS feeds ‚Üí expert curation ‚Üí educational pathways

Result: Early access + technical accuracy + educational processing = premium value
```

---

## üìä Corrected Content Processing Pipeline

### **Realistic Daily Volume**
```
üì° RSS MONITORING: 10,000+ items/day (lightweight background polling)
    ‚Üì (automated relevance filtering - 99% filtered out)
üîç RELEVANT CONTENT: ~100 articles/day requiring processing
    ‚Üì (deduplication and priority scoring - 50% removed)
üìã ALGORITHM CANDIDATES: ~50 unique stories
    ‚Üì (priority ranking algorithm)
‚≠ê RSS CANDIDATES: 15-20 high-priority articles

üéØ SECRET SAUCE STREAM: r/singularity manual curation
    ‚Üì (Drew's insider intelligence and technical expertise)
üèÜ INSIDER CONTENT: 3-5 exclusive developments/perspectives

‚úÖ FINAL CURATION: 5-10 MUST-KNOW stories (combining both streams)
```

### **Infrastructure Requirements (Corrected)**
```
PROCESSING VOLUME: ~100 articles/day (not 10,000!)
STORAGE NEEDS: 5-10GB annually for curated content + user data
MEMORY REQUIREMENTS: 4-6GB RAM adequate for realistic processing  
DATABASE: MariaDB sufficient for final content storage
CPU NEEDS: 2-4 cores adequate for classification and pathway generation
BANDWIDTH: Minimal for RSS polling + reasonable for site traffic
```

### **Why This Architecture Works**
- **RSS monitoring is lightweight** - just checking for new items
- **Heavy processing only on filtered content** - 100 articles vs 10,000
- **Human intelligence provides the premium value** - not automation scale
- **Quality over quantity** - insider content beats volume processing
- **Manageable infrastructure needs** - fits realistic hosting budgets
