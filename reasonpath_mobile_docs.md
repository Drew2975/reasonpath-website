- **Competitive Moat:** Only platform that transforms news → understanding → knowledge → application

**Strategic Value:** 
- Transform casual news reading into structured learning
- Location independence via mobile command center  
- Enterprise-grade automation at startup costs ($144/year vs $100k+ traditional)
- AI workforce controllable from mobile device
- Extensible platform for complete business automation

## 📰 The News-to-Knowledge Pipeline (Core Product)

### **The 5-Layer Processing System**

Every piece of external news flows through transformation layers that convert raw information into structured learning:

**1. 📡 Intake Layer**
- Raw news from 50+ RSS sources  
- 10,000 pieces/day incoming
- Zero-cost automation (no paid APIs initially)
- Free sources: TechCrunch, ArXiv, Hacker News, MIT Tech Review, etc.

**2. 🔄 Translation Layer**
- Convert technical jargon to plain English
- Add reality checks and hype scores
- Simplify without dumbing down
- Manual editing initially, AI-enhanced later

**3. 📚 Education Mapping Layer** *(The Competitive Moat)*
- Auto-link glossary terms (pattern matching against 150+ term database)
- Connect to relevant course content (rule-based mapping)
- Map to available labs and experiments
- **ONLY ReasonPath does this** - transforms news into learning pathways

**4. 🎚️ Depth Selection Layer**
- 5-second summary for busy readers
- 1-minute context for quick understanding  
- 5+ minute deep dive for comprehensive learning
- User chooses engagement level based on time/interest

**5. 👥 Community Enhancement Layer** *(Phase 2)*
- Expert annotations and insights
- Beginner questions and explanations
- Crowd-sourced learning improvements

### **The Content Funnel Strategy**
```
10,000 pieces/day (RSS aggregation)
    ↓ 
1,000 relevant (AI/tech filtered)
    ↓
100 unique stories (deduplicated)
    ↓  
20 important (priority scored)
    ↓
5-10 MUST KNOW (Drew's final curation)
```

### **Learning Pathway UX Design**

### **Human-in-the-Loop Editorial Workflow**

**Drew's Optimized Daily Process (15 minutes total):**

```
7:00 AM  - System aggregates overnight (automatic)
7:30 AM  - Deduplication + classification (automatic)  
8:00 AM  - Review dashboard ready (mobile or desktop)
8:02 AM  - Drew reviews pre-filtered stories via APK
8:05 AM  - Swipe approvals + manual story additions
8:10 AM  - Tap "Publish Approved Stories"
8:15 AM  - System generates learning pathways + deploys
8:20 AM  - Confirmation: "5 stories published to ReasonPath"
```

**Content Operations Dashboard Features:**
- Pre-classified by 6 categories (Models & Research, Policy, Industry, etc.)
- Duplicate detection with similarity scoring
- Manual story addition via URL paste or custom creation
- Inline editing of summaries and classifications
- Pathway suggestion with course/lab mapping
- One-click approval and deployment

### **RSS Aggregation & Classification Strategy**

**Zero-Cost Content Sources (50+ feeds):**
```python
# Primary Sources (High Weight)
feeds = [
    {'name': 'TechCrunch AI', 'url': 'https://techcrunch.com/ai/feed/', 'weight': 10},
    {'name': 'ArXiv AI', 'url': 'https://arxiv.org/rss/cs.AI', 'weight': 9},
    {'name': 'MIT Tech Review', 'url': 'https://technologyreview.com/feed/', 'weight': 9},
    {'name': 'Hacker News', 'url': 'https://news.ycombinator.com/rss', 'weight': 8},
    # 46+ additional sources...
]

# Rule-Based Classification (No API Costs)
def classify_story(title, content):
    if any(term in title.lower() for term in ['gpt', 'model', 'benchmark', 'training']):
        return 'Models & Research'
    elif any(term in title.lower() for term in ['regulation', 'policy', 'law', 'government']):
        return 'Policy & Regulation'
    # ... classification rules for all 6 categories

# Glossary Term Extraction (Pattern Matching)
def extract_terms(text):
    found_terms = []
    for term in glossary_database:  # 150+ terms
        if term.lower() in text.lower():
            found_terms.append(term)
    return found_terms[:5]  # Top 5 most relevant
```

**Content Quality Filters:**
- Minimum word count (300+ words)
- Relevance scoring (AI/tech keywords)
- Source credibility weighting
- Freshness priority (last 24 hours)
- Duplication removal (80% title similarity)

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Access Control
- **No Port Forwarding:** Cloudflare Tunnel (free) or Tailscale VPN
- **Device Binding:** APK paired once with cryptographic device ID
- **JWT Authentication:** Short-lived tokens (5-10 minutes) with auto-refresh
- **Daily Rotation:** Preview tokens change daily for security

### Request Security

  }
}
```

## 🔄 Database Architecture

### Snapshot Pattern (Eliminates Morning DB Locks)
```sql
-- Overnight: Work in live database
stories_work.db → All aggregation, processing, classification

-- 3:30 AM: Atomic handoff  
VACUUM INTO 'data/stories_snapshot.db'

-- Morning: Read-only operations only
stories_snapshot.db → APK reads, never writes
```

### Job Queue System
```sql
CREATE TABLE jobs (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    lane TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(lane IN ('news', 'automation')),
    operation TEXT NOT NULL,
    status TEXT DEFAULT 'queued',
    payload JSON,
    logs JSON DEFAULT '[]',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    started_at TIMESTAMP,
    completed_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_jobs_lane_status ON jobs(lane, status);
```
